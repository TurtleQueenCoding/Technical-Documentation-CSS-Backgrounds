# Technical-Documentation-CSS-Backgrounds
FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Technical Documentation

<p>This is the third project of the Responsive Web Design Certification in Free Code Camp. The objective of this challenge was to build a technical documentation page that meets the 15 user stories specified by Free Code Camp. I decided to do my project on CSS Backgrounds, since there was a thorough page for it on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Backgrounds_and_borders">the MDN Website</a>. I wanted to pick something I felt I could understand thoroughly enough to write a decent web page about it. Part of this challenge was using a media query to make the page responsive, and I created two different layouts for mobile and laptop users based on screen size. I'm looking forward to learning Javascript, which should help me create even better layouts for mobile users.
